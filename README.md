# bCIRT
Free CIRT incident management tracker tool.
The aim of this project is for me to:
-learn the Python Django framework
-develop a tool that I can use for my convinience
-give back to the community by sharing the tool

The project is based on the NIST framework and supports the standard incident response procedures used in the industry.

More to come...
