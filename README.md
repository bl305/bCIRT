Free CIRT incident management tracker tool.<br>
The aim of this project is for me to:<br>
-learn the Python Django framework<br>

-give back to the community by sharing the tool<br>
<br>
The project is based on the NIST framework and supports the standard incident response procedures used in the industry.<br>
